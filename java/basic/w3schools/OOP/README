OOP - Object-Oriented Programming
	Advantages:
		- Faster and easier
		- clear structure for the programs
		- helps to keep the code DRY (dont repeat yourself)
		- reusable aplications with less code and shorter development time

	CLASSES AND OBJECTS
		- both are main aspects of object-oriented programming
		- Ex.:
				CLASS 		|		OBJECTS		
			________________|_________________
				fruit		|		apple
							|		banana
							|		pineapple


				CLASS 		|		OBJECTS		
			________________|_________________
							|		BMW
					car		|		Volvo
							|		Fiat

		- So: a class is a template for objects
		- object is a instance of a class


	CLASS ATTRIBUTES

		- class attributes are variables within a class

		public class Main {
			int x = 40; // class attribute
			int y = 2; // class attribute
		}

	Accessing Attributes

		public class Main {
			int resposta = 42;
		

			public static void main(String[] args) {
				Main myObj = new Main();
				System.out.println(myObj.resposta);
				}
			}
